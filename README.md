# Adam Iskandar 👋

Full-Stack Developer · Security-focused systems  
I build fast, boring, secure things that last.

## About
I focus on how systems behave over time: predictable designs, auditable decisions, and fewer surprises. I started with web security and vulnerability research but prefer preventing problems by building simple, maintainable systems.

## Work
- Web platforms with hardened backends  
- Self-hosted, low-cost infrastructure where it makes sense  
- Security-aware tooling and practical reviews

## Skills
JavaScript · Node.js · Linux · Security reviews · Infrastructure-as-code

## How I work
Small scope, long-term thinking, fewer dependencies, privacy-first by default. I favour clarity and predictability over chasing trends.
